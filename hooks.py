"""mkdocs hooks: mirrored-content path rewrites, the Benchmarks nav, and the
untranslated-page notice.

* Mirrored design docs carry repo-relative paths (`../../tileops/...`) that do
  not resolve here; `on_page_markdown` rewrites them after include-markdown has
  pulled the content in.
* The Benchmarks pages are generated at deploy time and cannot be listed in
  `mkdocs.yml`; `on_config` expands that one nav entry to whatever the renderer
  produced.
* mkdocs-static-i18n serves the default-language page where a locale has no
  translation; `on_page_markdown` prepends a notice, so a fallback page reads as
  a translation still to come rather than a broken one.
