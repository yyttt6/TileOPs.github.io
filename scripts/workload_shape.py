"""Resolve a benchmarked workload to the shape and dtype of each input tensor.

The snapshot names a workload only by its pytest id
(``hidden-state-prefill-float16``); the shapes live in the TileOPs spec
manifest, ``src/tileops/manifest/*.yaml``, addressed by the ``<label>-<dtype>``
that id is built from.

A workload entry carries its shapes one of two ways: ``<tensor>_shape`` keys
outright, or ``signature.inputs.<tensor>.shape`` templates evaluated against
the workload's own scalars. Templates are read only where no shape is given
outright — all or nothing, so a tensor list is never half the op's inputs.
Whatever scalars are left over are reported as the manifest names them.

Anything the manifest declares as a parameter rather than a dimension
(``is_causal``, ``page_size``) is reported separately and only when it differs
from the signature's default: a workload that takes the default is the ordinary
case and saying so on every row costs more than it tells.

A workload the manifest does not declare at all — an edge-case probe the Ascend
harness adds, not a spec-driven one — has no manifest shape to read.
``describe_recorded`` describes those from the shape the snapshot itself
recorded; see the comment above it for why that is a fallback and not the
first thing tried.
